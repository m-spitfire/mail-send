# mail-send.py
This is a script that automates sending e-mails
### How to run the file
It has two different arguments `darshana` and `custom`.For example 
```py
python mail-send.py custom
```
Will let you to send a custom e-mail

Or you can create a `mail-send.bat`  file with this script:
```bat
@py.exe C:\path\to\file\mail-send.py
@pause
```
And save this in the `C:\Windows` folder so that when you do `win+R` and type `mail-send custom` you will run program without opening any terminals, or opening the file in some IDE or editor.

First is for my homework submission second is for custom e-mails, which you can even add attachments with different types of files.
